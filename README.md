# trivia_searcher
Web application that displays trivia questions based off search parameters such as category, difficulty, and airdate of Jeopardy question. In addition, basic favoriting functionality is implemented as well as a simple Jeopardy game board simulation. This application was created for this [challenge](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/jeopardy-api).

This was built using plain Javascript with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Moment](https://momentjs.com/), [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), and [CORS anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere).

A demo of the site can be viewed [here](https://willing-duck.surge.sh/)!
