# trivia_searcher
Web application that displays trivia questions based off search parameters such as category, difficulty, and airdate of Jeopardy question. In addition, basic favoriting functionality is implemented as well as a simple Jeopardy game board simulation. This application was created for this [challenge](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/jeopardy-api).

This was built using plain Javascript with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Moment](https://momentjs.com/), and [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/).

## Setup
View [here](https://trivia-searcher.herokuapp.com).
Since jService is not SSl-certified you will have to load in my "unsafe scripts" to be able to run the web app. Sorry about that. If you are not comfortable with that simply run locally by cloning this repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/jeffersonxu/SeniorMania.git
```
